# PC Fan Controller for Athena Power Cases

This repository contains the circuit board and firmware for a fan controller which I designed to replace the splitter which ships with the Athena Power RM-1UC138 rackmount computer case.

Instead of running the bundled 12 V fans at full speed, this controller allows you to install your own PWM fans, and set a fixed speed via a potentiometer, with no involvement from the motherboard.
